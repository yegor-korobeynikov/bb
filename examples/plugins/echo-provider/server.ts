/**
 * Echo provider — a complete third-party agent provider plugin.
 *
 * Surfaces demonstrated:
 * - bb.agents.experimental_registerProvider: the provider declaration (id,
 *   picker metadata, and pre-session capability facts). Metadata only — the
 *   implementation is the bridge below, and a declaration without one is
 *   refused.
 * - bb.host (package.json): the plugin's one host artifact. host.ts exports
 *   both the provider bridge (named export, run by the daemon's bridge
 *   bootstrap) and a host RPC entry (default export, run by the daemon's host
 *   worker) — one artifact, two consumers, two process lifecycles. The server
 *   stores it content-addressed and enrolled host daemons download,
 *   hash-verify, and run it.
 *
 * The bridge itself lives in src/provider-bridge.ts and implements the
 * canonical Provider Bridge Protocol (docs/provider-bridge-protocol.md)
 * minimally but correctly — its conformance test drives the official kit
 * against it in-process.
