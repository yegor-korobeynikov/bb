/**
 * The plugin bundle build engine — frontend (design §5.1) and prebuilt
 * backend (design §6) bundles. One implementation
 * shared by its two real callers: `bb plugin build` in the CLI, and the
 * server's install-time / boot-time (SDK skew) rebuilds of path:/git:
 * plugins. The heavy toolchain (esbuild, Tailwind's native oxide scanner) is
 * dynamically imported inside {@link buildPluginApp}, so merely importing
 * this package never loads native addons — a server that rebuilds nothing
 * pays nothing.
 *
 * Neither shipped caller depends on that toolchain: they resolve it with
 * {@link resolvePluginBuildToolchain}, which installs a pinned set into the
 * data dir the first time something is actually built. Only the monorepo's
 * own build scripts use the bare-specifier default, where the packages are
 * devDependencies.
