/**
 * The provider bridge kit: the runtime-agnostic building blocks a bridge
 * process uses to speak the canonical protocol — JSON-RPC plumbing, the stdio
 * harness, tool-call and interaction codecs, provider-dialect parsing
 * helpers, and the visibility classification every bb-authored bridge shares.
 * Timeline assembly (turn/item id minting, accepted-input correlation, item
 * settlement) is not here: bridges emit `thread/delta` and the runtime's
 * delta assembler owns all of it.
 *
 * A bridge ships from its plugin as a self-contained bundle, so everything
 * here must stay free of `@bb/agent-runtime` (the runtime imports the kit, not
 * the other way round).
