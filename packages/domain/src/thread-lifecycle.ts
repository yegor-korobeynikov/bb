/**
 * What happened to a thread, in product terms. Callers report events instead
 * of choosing target statuses; THREAD_LIFECYCLE maps (status, event) → next
 * status and THREAD_LIFECYCLE_EVENT_PREDICATES declares which staleness
 * signals supersede each event.
 *
 * The execution status is the single source of truth for "what is this thread
 * doing": `idle` (quiescent), `starting` (preparing a run), `active` (agent
 * work is in progress), `stopping` (the current run/start is winding down),
 * and `error` (quiescent after failure). In-progress intent lives in the
 * status, not in side-fields: a requested stop IS `status = stopping`, not a
 * separate `stopRequestedAt`. Only the orthogonal record dimensions
 * (deletedAt/archivedAt) are fields, surfaced here as supersession predicates.
 *
 * Events carry no payloads yet: the threads row stores no turn id, and neither
 * the table, the predicates, nor the db writer consumes any event data.
 *
 * Vocabulary:
 * - `run.preparing` — new work needs preparation before it can run.
 * - `run.started` — the current run is in progress.
 * - `run.succeeded` — the current run completed successfully.
 * - `run.failed` — the current run/start failed.
 * - `stop.requested` — the user/system asked to stop the current run/start.
 * - `stop.settled` — stop/interruption finished and the thread is idle.
