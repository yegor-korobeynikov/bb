import type { EnvironmentStatus } from "./environment.js";

/**
 * What happened to an environment, in product terms. Callers report events
 * instead of choosing target statuses; ENVIRONMENT_LIFECYCLE maps
 * (status, event) → next status and ENVIRONMENT_LIFECYCLE_EVENT_PREDICATES
 * declares which row-level signals supersede each event.
 *
 * Unlike thread events, three destroy events carry a `destroyAttemptId`
 * payload: the db writer stamps it on start and the evaluator compares it
 * on completion/failure settlement, replacing the old per-attempt CAS in
 * restoreEnvironmentAfterDestroyAttemptFailure.
 *
 * Vocabulary (sources are the call sites inventoried in
 * packages/domain/test/environment-lifecycle.test.ts):
 * - `provision.requested` — (re)provisioning starts for an existing
 *   environment record.
 * - `provision.succeeded` — provisioning completed and the workspace is ready.
 * - `provision.failed` — provisioning failed.
 * - `provision.cancelled` — provisioning was abandoned because every
 *   dependent thread stopped or cancelled; the environment returns to ready
 *   when a workspace exists, or enters destroy when there is no workspace.
 * - `retire.requested` — the environment became cleanup-eligible and is now
 *   scheduled for cleanup, but destroy has not started yet.
 * - `retire.cancelled` — a work request revived a retiring environment before
 *   cleanup started destroy.
 * - `destroy.started` — cleanup started destroying a retiring/error
 *   environment (stamps destroyAttemptId).
 * - `destroy.completed` — the matching destroy completed; the workspace is
 *   gone, or no workspace existed (`destroyAttemptId: null`).
 * - `destroy.failed` — destroy failed; the matching attempt restores cleanup
 *   intent for retry.
 * - `destroy.lost` — destroy result was lost and workspace existence is
 *   unknown.
