Thread commands

Every command supports --json for machine-readable output.

Spawning:

  bb thread spawn --project <id> --prompt "..." [options]

    --prompt <prompt>              Initial prompt (required)
    --title <title>                Thread title
    --project <id>                 Project (required)
    --parent-thread <id>           Parent thread (may be in another project)
    --parent-self                  Parent to the current thread (BB_THREAD_ID)
    --provider <id>                Provider override
    --model <model>                Model override
    --reasoning-level <level>      Reasoning level: low, medium, high, xhigh, max (provider-dependent)
    --environment <id-or-path>     Attach to an existing environment (ID or workspace path)
    --new-environment <kind>       Create a new environment (worktree)
    --base-branch <branch>         Base branch for a new managed worktree
    --machine <id-or-name>         Run on a machine (--host is an alias)
    --service-tier <tier>          Service tier: fast, default
    --permission-mode <mode>       Permission mode: accept-edits, auto, or full
    --section <id>                 Create the thread in a section
    --visibility <visibility>      visible or hidden; a child inherits its parent by default
    --file <path>                  Host-readable absolute or uploaded file path
    --image <path>                 Host-readable absolute or uploaded image path
    --origin-kind <kind>           Create a fork thread
    --source-thread <id>           Source thread for a fork
    --source-seq-end <seq>         Last included source event sequence

  Execution defaults resolve from explicit flags, live parent execution, and
  remembered project defaults. With no remembered model, bb uses the explicitly
  requested provider or Codex and resolves its provider-reported default model
  on the target machine. The product reasoning and permission defaults are
  medium and auto.
  accept-edits uses workspace sandboxing with user-reviewed escalation. auto uses
  the same workspace sandbox with provider-native automatic review. full is the
  explicit sandbox and approval bypass. Plan mode is separate from permissions.
  Subagents inherit the parent's permission mode by default, and the parent's mode is a hard ceiling: a child's requested mode can lower it but never exceed it, so a sandboxed parent cannot spawn a full-access child.
  Parenting is opt-in. Inside a thread, pass --parent-self to parent the new thread to the current thread.
  Hidden threads are for plugin/background workers. They remain addressable by
  ID while staying out of sidebar organization and unread/pending favicon
  attention. Thread lists exclude them unless
  --include-hidden is passed; direct-ID operations remain available.
  A new child thread inherits the visibility of its parent, so the subagents of
  a hidden thread stay hidden too. Pass --visibility to override the inherited
  value. A hidden child still reports its turns and blockers to its parent
  thread; only source-derived forks stay silent.
  A machine selector accepts an exact ID or an unambiguous name. It works with
  an unmanaged --environment path, --new-environment worktree, or the personal
  workspace. It cannot be combined with an existing environment ID because that
  environment already selects its machine. Without the flag, local/primary
  machine resolution is unchanged.

Forking:

  bb thread fork <source-thread-id> [options]

    --prompt <prompt>              Optional first prompt; omit for an idle fork
    --source-seq-end <seq>         Fork at this source event sequence (tip by default)
    --workspace <mode>             isolated (default) or reuse
    --title <title>                Thread title
    --permission-mode <mode>       Inherit source by default; accepts accept-edits, auto, full
    --visibility <visibility>      visible (default) or hidden
    --agent-context-seed <text>    Persist agent-only context without a first run
    --file <path>                  Host-readable absolute or uploaded file path
    --image <path>                 Host-readable absolute or uploaded image path

  Forks clone the source provider session on the same machine. Isolated forks
  create a fresh managed worktree (or personal workspace for personal threads);
  reuse attaches the source environment. Omit --prompt to create an idle fork.

Editing a sent message (requires the default-on `editMessages` experiment):

  bb thread edit-message <id> --message "Replacement text"
    --self                              Target the current thread (BB_THREAD_ID)
    --expected-request-sequence <seq>   Select the message and reject a stale target

  Without --expected-request-sequence, the latest eligible message is edited.
  Codex, Claude Code, and Pi threads are supported. The original conversation
  remains unchanged until the provider prepares the replacement history.
  Failed and incomplete turns are eligible. If the thread is running,
  submission stops the current turn and waits for it to settle. It then
  replaces the selected turn and every later turn while retaining workspace
  changes. From an agent thread, the command carries `BB_THREAD_ID` so the
  replacement runs under agent permission policy.

Listing:

  bb thread list                           List threads
    --project <id>                         Filter by project
    --parent-thread <id>                   Filter by parent thread
    --archived                             Show only archived threads
    --section <id>                         Filter by section
    --unsectioned                          Show only threads outside sections
    --include-hidden                       Include hidden threads

  The table prints ID, Title, Project, and Status. Title uses the thread
  title, then the fallback title from the first prompt, then "-". Long
  titles are cut at 60 characters. Project shows the project name; the
  personal project shows "-". Use --json for the full thread records.

  bb thread search <query>                 Search threads and messages
  bb thread history <id>                   List prompt history

Sections:

  bb thread section list
  bb thread section create <name>
  bb thread section rename <id> <name>
  bb thread section delete <id> [--yes]

Inspecting:

  bb thread show [id]                      Show thread details and pull request status
    --self                                 Target current thread
    --work-status                          Include git working-tree status
    --git-diff                             Include git diff
    --diff-target <type>                   Diff scope: uncommitted, branch_committed, all, commit
    --diff-sha <sha>                       Commit SHA (for --diff-target commit)
    --diff-merge-base <branch>             Override merge-base branch for diff
    --merge-base-branches                  List available merge-base branches

  Shows pull request status for the attached environment branch when available.

  bb thread log [id]                       Show thread event log
    --self                                 Target current thread
    --format <format>                      Output format: json, minimal, verbose
    --limit <count>                        Limit entries
    --after-seq <seq>                      Paginate after sequence number

  bb thread output [id]                    Get the final output of a thread
    --self                                 Target current thread

  bb thread wait <id>                      Wait for a thread status or event (defaults to --status idle)
    --status <status>                      Wait for this status
    --event <type>                         Wait for this event type
    --timeout <seconds>                    Timeout in seconds (default: 1200 / 20 min)
    --poll-interval <ms>                   Polling interval in milliseconds

Opening threads and files in the app:

  bb thread open <path>                    Open a file in the current BB thread panel
  bb thread open <thread-id> [path]        Open a thread, optionally with a panel file
    --line <number>                        Line number to focus
    --split <placement>                    right, down, left, top, or replace
  bb thread pane <action> [thread-id]      Maximize, restore, toggle, spotlight, or clear spotlight

  Inside a BB thread, BB_THREAD_ID selects the current thread automatically and
  the thread ID argument is omitted for file-only opens. Pass an explicit thread
  ID with --split to open another thread. Outside a BB thread, pass the thread ID
  as the first argument. A thread already open in a pane is focused instead of
  duplicated. Edge placement creates panes through the eighth pane; at eight
  panes, it replaces the focused pane.
  Pane actions broadcast to connected BB app windows and affect the matching
  already-open pane without changing its split tree. Spotlight focuses that
  pane and dims the others; clear-spotlight focuses it and removes split dimming.
  Paths can be thread-relative workspace paths, or absolute paths inside the
  target thread workspace. Absolute paths under BB_THREAD_STORAGE open as
  thread-storage files for the current thread. Use this for Markdown or HTML
  artifacts you create for the user so they open in the BB IDE.

Messaging:

  bb thread tell <id> <message>            Send a follow-up message
    --mode <mode>                          Message mode: steer (default), queue, or auto
    --model <model>                        Model override for this turn
    --reasoning-level <level>              Reasoning level override
    --file <path>                          Host-readable absolute or uploaded file path
    --image <path>                         Host-readable absolute or uploaded image path

  Tell steers by default, delivering the message immediately into the active
  turn. Use --mode queue for non-urgent follow-ups that can wait until the agent
  is free.

  bb thread stop [id]                      Stop work and release the agent runtime
  bb thread compact [id]                   Request compaction of an idle or errored thread's context
  bb thread cancel-plan [id]               Exit the provider's active Plan mode
  bb thread clear-goal [id]                Clear the provider's active Goal
    --self                                 Target current thread

  `thread compact` enqueues the same structured /compact turn used by the
  composer. Follow the thread timeline for the eventual compaction result.

Ownership:

  bb thread update [id]                    Update thread metadata
    --self                                 Target current thread
    --title <title>                        Set title
    --parent-thread <id>                   Assign to a parent thread
    --clear-parent-thread                  Remove parent assignment
    --section <id>                         Move into a section
    --clear-section                        Remove section assignment
    --model <model>                        Set the sticky model for the next and later turns
    --reasoning-level <level>              Set the sticky reasoning level (provider-dependent)
    --visibility <visibility>              Set visible or hidden

  Model and reasoning updates stay within the thread's current provider. BB
  validates them against that provider's current model catalog, applies them on
  the next turn, and keeps using them on later turns until changed.

  bb thread read [id]                      Mark read
  bb thread unread [id]                    Mark unread
  bb thread reorder-pinned <id> [--after <id>] [--before <id>]

Queued messages:

  bb thread queue list <thread-id>
  bb thread queue create <thread-id> <message>
  bb thread queue update <thread-id> <message-id> <message> [--file <path>] [--image <path>]
  bb thread queue send <thread-id> <message-id> [--mode auto|steer]
  bb thread queue reorder <thread-id> <message-id> [--after <id>] [--before <id>]
  bb thread queue group <thread-id> <boundary-id> --prefix <comma-separated-ids>
  bb thread queue delete <thread-id> <message-id>

Persisted panel tabs:

  bb thread tabs show <thread-id>
  bb thread tabs set <thread-id> --expected-revision <n> --tabs-json '<json>'

Lifecycle:

  bb thread archive [id]                   Archive a thread (and children/hidden forks)
    --self                                 Archive current thread

  `thread stop` preserves the thread history, metadata, environment, and future
  resume behavior. It stops active work and releases an idle agent runtime.
  The command succeeds when no runtime is loaded. Archive a finished hidden
  worker first, then stop it to release memory promptly. A stop that only
  releases an idle runtime adds no interruption: it leaves the timeline and any
  pending interaction of that thread untouched.

  bb thread unarchive [id]                 Unarchive a thread
    --self                                 Unarchive current thread

  bb thread delete <id>                    Delete permanently
    --yes                                  Skip confirmation

Read-only commands require a thread ID or --self where supported.
Mutating thread lifecycle and messaging commands require an explicit ID or --self.
