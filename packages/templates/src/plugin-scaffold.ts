 *
 * The import rewrite is part of the same job as removing the path map: that map
 * is what made `@bb/plugin-sdk` resolve, so a migration that dropped it and
 * left the specifiers behind would hand back a plugin that no longer
 * typechecks. Only quoted specifiers are replaced (`"@bb/plugin-sdk"`,
 * `'@bb/plugin-sdk/app'`), subpath and quote style preserved — which does
 * include a quoted specifier written inside a comment.
 *
 * This is a workspace-local file transform, not product policy — the CLI owns
 * the consent gate (`bb plugin migrate` never runs without confirmation),
 * because the legacy layout keeps working this release and a plugin must never
 * be migrated out from under its author.
 *
 * Idempotent by construction: every step is expressed as a difference against
 * what is on disk, so a second run reports `changed: false` rather than
 * failing, and a half-migrated plugin (pin already added, `types/` still
 * present) converges instead of being rejected.
 *
 * A plugin with no vendored artifacts left is not a special case: the manifest
 * steps still run, so a half-migrated plugin that lost its `types/` and path
 * maps without ever gaining the pin reports `changed: true` and gets the pin
 * and floor.
 *
 * Safety mirrors {@link syncPluginTypes}: symlinks are refused rather than
 * followed, `types/` must resolve inside the plugin, and both manifests are
 * replaced through an atomic rename. Planning happens before any write, so a
 * refusal leaves the plugin exactly as it was, and every destructive step
 * re-validates immediately before it runs.
 *
 * Both JSON files are rewritten through `JSON.parse`/`JSON.stringify`, so a
 * pathological numeric literal in a field this transform does not touch
 * (`1e400`, an integer above 2^53) can come back normalized. Manifest and
 * tsconfig fields are strings, objects, and small integers in practice, so
 * this is accepted rather than worked around with a JSON-preserving editor.

## Manifest

\`package.json\` is the plugin manifest. Notable fields:

- \`bb.server\` — backend entry (required); optional \`bb.app\` for a frontend.
- \`bb.name\` and \`bb.description\` — required human-facing identity.
- \`bb.branding\` — required; declare \`icon\` as a BB icon name or a
  plugin-relative compact SVG, or declare \`logo.light\` (with optional
  \`logo.dark\`). Logo assets must be relative \`.svg\`, \`.png\`, or
  \`.webp\` files.
- \`engines.bb\` — supported bb app version range.
- \`engines.bbPluginSdk\` — the lowest plugin SDK you need (scaffold:
  \`>=${PLUGIN_SDK_VERSION}\`). BB reads this as a floor, not a ceiling: a later
  SDK in the same major still loads your plugin.
- \`dependencies\` — every package your source imports that BB does not provide.
  \`bb plugin build\` inlines them into \`dist/\`, and git installs resolve this
  list alone, so a build-required package here rather than in
  \`devDependencies\` is what keeps your plugin installable. \`devDependencies\`
  is for types and tooling only (BB shims React, the portal primitives, and
  \`@get-bb/plugin-sdk\` at runtime — never bundle them).

Run \`bb plugin build\` before publishing git/npm installs. It writes
\`dist/server.js\` + \`server.meta.json\` (and, with \`bb.app\`, \`app.js\` /
\`app.css\` / \`app.meta.json\`). Each \`*.meta.json\` stamps SDK major/version,
\`artifactFormatVersion\`, \`pluginId\`, \`pluginVersion\`, and
\`builtWith\` so managed installs can verify the artifacts.

## Install

From this directory (\`bb plugin new\` already ran the install; a fresh clone
needs it):

\`\`\`
npm install
bb plugin install .
\`\`\`

After editing sources, reload:

\`\`\`
bb plugin reload ${id}
\`\`\`

## Configure

\`\`\`
bb plugin config ${id}
bb plugin config ${id} set greeting hi
\`\`\`

## Types & API reference

The plugin API ships as the npm package \`@get-bb/plugin-sdk\`, pinned to an
exact version in \`devDependencies\` (\`${PLUGIN_SDK_VERSION}\` — the SDK of the BB
that scaffolded this plugin). After \`npm install\`, the full surface is on disk
at:

\`\`\`
node_modules/@get-bb/plugin-sdk/bundled-types/bb-plugin-sdk.d.ts      # backend
node_modules/@get-bb/plugin-sdk/bundled-types/bb-plugin-sdk-app.d.ts  # frontend
\`\`\`

Your editor and \`tsc\` resolve \`@get-bb/plugin-sdk\` there through ordinary node
resolution — no path mapping. These are readable declarations: open them for an
exact signature.

The SDK surface grows with every BB release, so the pin has to track the BB you
actually run:

\`\`\`
bb plugin types          # sync this plugin's SDK surface to the running BB
bb plugin types --check  # CI: fail when it does not match
\`\`\`

Ask BB to write plugins for you: the \`bb-plugin-authoring\` skill documents
the whole surface with examples.

Confused by the API, or need something the types don't explain? Clone the BB
repo and read the source: <https://github.com/get-bb/bb>.
