/**
 * Maps a validated plugin provider declaration
 * (`bb.agents.experimental_registerProvider`) onto the registry's wire shapes:
 * the client-facing `ProviderInfo` and the backend-only
 * `ProviderServerCapabilities`. Declarations are the only source of provider
 * metadata, so every field a consumer reads must be declarable.
 *
 * Every declared fact a registry consumer reads lands in one of the two
 * shapes — client-facing facts on `ProviderInfo`, backend-only ones on
 * `ProviderServerCapabilities`. Facts nothing reads (`kind`, `bridge`) are
 * deliberately dropped rather than stashed: a registration that also carries
 * the raw declaration invites consumers to read around the projection, and
 * then there are two answers to every capability question.
