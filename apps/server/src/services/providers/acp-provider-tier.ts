/**
 * The dynamic ACP tier.
 *
 * Built-in ACP providers are ordinary plugin declarations in the registry.
 * User-configured custom agents (`acp-<slug>`) remain dynamic: they are
 * resolved from config at request time and therefore need a shared capability
 * fallback. This module owns that fallback and the custom-provider info shape.
 *
 * Capabilities that vary for a user-configured ACP agent are declared on its
 * config record and resolved by
 * `system/acp-launch-spec.ts::resolveAcpAgentCapabilitiesForProviderId`.
 *
 * The external agent owns model selection, tool execution, and session naming,
 * so BB-side capabilities stay minimal. Permission modes are enforced
 * cooperatively by the ACP bridge (permission-request policy + client fs write
 * policy). Fork support is the declared offer; each agent's real answer is
 * negotiated at the bridge handshake before the unstable ACP session/fork
 * request is sent. Service tier is supported because Cursor exposes a `-fast`
 * model tail that the bridge resolves from the tier rather than fanning fast
 * variants out as separate model-list entries.
