/**
 * The provisional Claude Code model rows the server substitutes when the
 * daemon's account-scoped probe fails transiently, so the picker is populated
 * instead of empty and the real failure defers to submit time.
 *
 * These are pinned model ids, so an account without the matching entitlement or
 * CLI version will not be able to run every one of them. This list is never
 * authoritative: absence from it is not proof that a stored model was retired,
 * and only a successful probe may trigger model recovery.
 *
 * DEBT: the daemon keeps its own copy (agent-runtime's
 * claude-code/model-catalog.ts, which filters it against the probe) and the app
 * keeps a third for cold-cache placeholder rows (system-queries.ts). One copy
 * per consumer is the established shape on this branch — a shared package for
 * it is exactly the coupling the provider catalog package was deleted to
 * remove. They converge when the claude-code plugin owns its provider metadata
 * and serves these rows.
