/**
 * Test registries seeded with the first-party providers.
 *
 * Production gets its providers from the four first-party provider plugins;
 * there is no core seed to fall back on. Most server tests need those
 * providers but cannot afford to install and run four plugins, so this helper
 * takes the SAME declarations those plugins register — by invoking their
 * server entrypoints against a capture stub — and pushes them through the same
 * validation and mapping the plugin runtime uses. Nothing is re-stated here,
 * so a declaration change cannot drift from what the tests assume.
 *
 * The plugin modules load by dynamic import rather than a static one: they
 * live outside this package's rootDir, exactly as they do for the real plugin
 * runtime, which also imports them as untyped modules and validates what comes
 * back.
