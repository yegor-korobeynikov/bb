/**
 * The ONE place a host `ThreadListEntry` becomes the plugin-facing
 * `PluginSidebarThread`. Two mappers would drift; this one is unit-tested
 * against the host's own indicator precedence.
 *
 * `hasUnsubmittedDraft` is deliberately not part of the mapping: an
 * unsubmitted composer draft is per-client, per-composer state that the
 * built-in row reads with its own hook, and one array-wide mapper cannot call
 * a hook per thread.
 *
 * So `indicator` never reports "draft" or "working-draft". The one visible
 * consequence: an idle, unread, successful thread that also holds a draft
 * reads as "unread-success" here where the built-in row paints "draft". Every
 * other state is unaffected, because a draft outranks nothing else.
