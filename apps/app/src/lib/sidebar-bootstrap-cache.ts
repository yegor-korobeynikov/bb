/**
 * The last sidebar bootstrap this profile received: sections, projects with
 * their thread lists, and the personal project. Replayed as placeholder data
 * on the next full load so the sidebar (and every surface that reads project
 * names from the shared cache) paints the rail this browser last saw instead
 * of a loading skeleton the real rows then replace. One entry per origin: the
 * endpoint has no routing dimensions.
 *
 * Provisional like every last-known value: rows are navigation, so a stale
 * row degrades to an in-page load failure at worst, and the live response
 * replaces the replay in place when it lands.
 *
 * The stored copy is bounded and written off the critical path. The live
 * response carries every unarchived thread of every project, so a large
 * profile could otherwise block the main thread serializing it right after
 * the fetch resolved, exceed the storage quota, and pay the parse again on
 * the next load. Projects are kept whole (consumers resolve the current
 * project by id from the replay) and each project's thread list is capped:
 * the first rows are the ones the rail paints first, and the rest arrive with
 * the live response.
