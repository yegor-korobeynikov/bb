/**
 * When to start loading plugin frontends (plugin design §5.1).
 *
 * Every running plugin ships its own bundle (several MB unminified across the
 * default set) plus a stylesheet. Booting them the moment `/system/config`
 * resolves put all of that parse/eval and style work into the window in which
 * the route chunk was still downloading — on a phone, the most contended
 * window of the whole page load. This scheduler starts boot after the first
 * route content has painted and the main thread is idle, with a hard timeout
 * so plugins never wait on a route that does not resolve.
 *
 * Plugin panel routes (`/plugins/:pluginId/...`) skip the wait: the plugin
 * bundle *is* the page there, and the reconcile pass loads that plugin first.
