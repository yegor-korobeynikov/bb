/**
 * A localStorage cache for "last-known truth": the last verified answer a
 * surface received, replayed on the next mount so first paint shows real data
 * instead of a neutral default that the live answer then replaces.
 *
 * Contract for consumers:
 * - Treat replayed values as provisional (TanStack `placeholderData`,
 *   snapshot-seeded state) and keep every irreversible action gated on the
 *   live result.
 * - Write only verified results, never a fallback or an error-state stand-in.
 * - Bump `version` when the stored shape changes; entries from other versions
 *   are pruned on first use, and every read is validated against `schema` so a
 *   stale or hand-edited entry can never leak into the app as trusted data.
 *
 * Neither reads nor writes throw: a full store or a restricted browser (a
 * SecurityError on `localStorage` itself) degrades to "no cache", which is
 * what a cache is for. In particular a write inside a query function must
 * never turn a successful fetch into a query error, and a read during render
 * must never take the surface down.
