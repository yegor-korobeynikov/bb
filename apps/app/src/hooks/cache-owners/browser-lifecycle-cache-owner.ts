/**

 * cancelled queries are remembered so the resume can pick them back up.
 * Cancelling reverts a first load to `pending`/`idle` with no data, and a
 * query with `refetchOnWindowFocus: false` (the realtime-owned policies) has
 * nothing else that restarts it: no focus refetch, no realtime change for it,
 * and no reconnect wave when the socket stayed healthy. Left alone it would
 * sit on its loading state until the next mount.
