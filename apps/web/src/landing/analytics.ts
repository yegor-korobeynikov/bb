 * PostHog wiring for the landing page.

 * Autocapture is off; the page emits only the explicit events below. UTM
 * parameters and the referrer are captured automatically by posthog-js on
 * `$pageview` and persisted as initial person properties, which is what links
 * ad campaigns to the download/install funnel.
 *
 * posthog-js is loaded lazily so it stays out of the critical-path bundle of
 * the ad landing page. Events fired before it finishes loading are queued and
 * flushed on init. Everything is a no-op unless VITE_POSTHOG_KEY is set at
 * build time, so local dev and forks ship with analytics disabled by default.
